There's something magical about hackathons - the adrenaline rush of building something revolutionary in just 48 hours, surrounded by brilliant minds and fueled by endless coffee. When my team and I walked into **HackIreland 2024**, we had a bold vision: create an AI system that could watch CCTV footage and generate natural language alerts about security incidents. 48 hours later, we walked out as **first place winners** with **Invision-Transformer CCTV AI** - a system that revolutionizes how we think about intelligent surveillance.

## The Challenge: Making CCTV Systems Intelligent üëÅÔ∏è

Traditional CCTV systems are essentially digital VCRs - they record everything but understand nothing. Security personnel spend countless hours watching footage, often missing critical incidents buried in hours of mundane recordings. The challenge we set for ourselves was ambitious:

**Can we build an AI system that watches CCTV footage like a human security expert and communicates what it sees in natural language?**

The answer turned out to be a resounding yes, but the journey was anything but straightforward.

## The Vision: Natural Language Security Alerts üí≠

Imagine a CCTV system that could send you alerts like:
- *"Suspicious person loitering near the main entrance for 15 minutes"*
- *"Unattended bag detected in the lobby area for 8 minutes"*
- *"Person fell down on Level 2, possible medical emergency"*
- *"Unauthorized access attempt at security door using unknown keycard"*

Instead of scrolling through hours of footage, security teams would receive intelligent, contextual alerts that help them respond to incidents immediately.

## Architecture: Transformers Meet Computer Vision üèóÔ∏è

Our solution combines the power of **Vision Transformers** for understanding video content with **language models** for generating natural language descriptions. Here's how we architected the system:

```python

            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, len(self.security_event_types))
        )
        
        self.security_event_types = [

    def process_video_sequence(self, video_frames: torch.Tensor) -> Dict:

        # Stack frame features: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)

        # Reshape for transformer: (seq_len, batch_size, hidden_size)
        sequence_features = sequence_features.transpose(0, 1)
        temporal_features = self.temporal_encoder(sequence_features)
        
        # Get sequence representation (average across time)
        sequence_repr = temporal_features.mean(dim=0)  # (batch_size, hidden_size)

        }
```

## The Vision Processing Pipeline üé•

The first challenge was teaching our system to understand what's happening in CCTV footage. We built a sophisticated video processing pipeline:

```python
class VideoAnalysisProcessor:
    def __init__(self, model: InvisionTransformer):
        self.model = model
        self.frame_buffer = []
        self.sequence_length = 16  # Analyze 16-frame sequences
        self.suspicious_threshold = 0.7
        
    def process_live_feed(self, video_stream_url: str) -> None:
        """Process live CCTV feed in real-time"""
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_stream_url)
        
        while True:
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                break
            
            # Preprocess frame
            processed_frame = self._preprocess_frame(frame)
            self.frame_buffer.append(processed_frame)
            
            # Analyze when we have enough frames
            if len(self.frame_buffer) >= self.sequence_length:
                analysis_result = self._analyze_sequence(
                    self.frame_buffer[-self.sequence_length:]
                )
                
                # Generate alert if suspicious activity detected
                if analysis_result['max_suspicion'] > self.suspicious_threshold:
                    alert = self._generate_natural_language_alert(analysis_result)
                    self._send_security_alert(alert)
                
                # Sliding window approach
                self.frame_buffer = self.frame_buffer[-8:]  # Keep half for overlap
    
    def _preprocess_frame(self, frame: np.ndarray) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Preprocess video frame for Vision Transformer"""
        # Resize to expected input size
        frame_resized = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
        
        # Convert BGR to RGB
        frame_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(frame_resized, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        
        # Normalize pixel values
        frame_normalized = frame_rgb / 255.0
        
        # Convert to tensor and add batch dimension
        frame_tensor = torch.from_numpy(frame_normalized).float()
        frame_tensor = frame_tensor.permute(2, 0, 1)  # HWC -> CHW
        
        return frame_tensor
    
    def _analyze_sequence(self, frame_sequence: List[torch.Tensor]) -> Dict:
        """Analyze a sequence of frames for security events"""
        # Stack frames into sequence tensor
        sequence_tensor = torch.stack(frame_sequence).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dim
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            analysis = self.model.process_video_sequence(sequence_tensor)
        
        # Interpret results
        event_probs = analysis['event_probabilities'][0]  # Remove batch dim
        max_prob_idx = torch.argmax(event_probs)
        max_prob = event_probs[max_prob_idx].item()
        
        detected_event = self.model.security_event_types[max_prob_idx]
        
        return {
            'detected_event': detected_event,
            'confidence': max_prob,
            'max_suspicion': max_prob if detected_event != 'normal_activity' else 0,
            'all_probabilities': event_probs.tolist(),
            'sequence_features': analysis['sequence_features']
        }
```

## Natural Language Alert Generation üìù

The real innovation was generating human-readable alerts. We fine-tuned GPT-2 to understand security contexts and generate appropriate language:

```python
class SecurityAlertGenerator:
    def __init__(self, language_model, tokenizer):
        self.language_model = language_model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        
        # Template prompts for different security events
        self.alert_templates = {
            "suspicious_loitering": [
                "A person has been loitering in the {location} area for {duration} minutes. Possible suspicious activity.",
                "Individual detected remaining stationary near {location} for an extended period ({duration} minutes).",
                "Suspicious behavior: Person lingering at {location} for {duration} minutes without clear purpose."
            ],
            "unattended_object": [
                "Unattended bag or object detected in {location} for {duration} minutes. Potential security risk.",
                "Object left unattended at {location}. Duration: {duration} minutes. Requires investigation.",
                "Security alert: Suspicious package at {location}, unattended for {duration} minutes."
            ],
            "person_fall": [
                "Person down detected in {location}. Possible medical emergency requiring immediate attention.",
                "Fall incident detected at {location}. Individual appears to need medical assistance.",
                "Medical alert: Person has fallen in {location} area. Emergency response may be required."
            ],
            "unauthorized_access": [
                "Unauthorized access attempt detected at {location}. Security breach possible.",
                "Access control violation at {location}. Individual attempting entry without proper authorization.",
                "Security warning: Unauthorized person attempting to access restricted area at {location}."
            ]
        }
    
    def generate_contextual_alert(self, 
                                event_type: str, 
                                confidence: float,
                                location: str = "monitored area",
                                duration: int = None,
                                additional_context: Dict = None) -> str:
        """Generate natural language security alert with context"""
        
        if event_type == "normal_activity":
            return None  # No alert needed
        
        # Select appropriate template
        templates = self.alert_templates.get(event_type, [
            f"Security event detected: {event_type} in {location}"
        ])
        
        # Choose template based on confidence (higher confidence -> more urgent language)
        if confidence > 0.9:
            template_idx = 0  # Most urgent
        elif confidence > 0.8:
            template_idx = min(1, len(templates) - 1)
        else:
            template_idx = min(2, len(templates) - 1)
        
        base_alert = templates[template_idx]
        
        # Fill in context variables
        alert = base_alert.format(
            location=location,
            duration=duration or "unknown",
            confidence=f"{confidence:.1%}"
        )
        
        # Add confidence level
        if confidence < 0.8:
            alert += f" (Confidence: {confidence:.1%})"
        
        # Use language model to enhance the alert if needed
        if additional_context:
            enhanced_alert = self._enhance_with_language_model(alert, additional_context)
            return enhanced_alert
        
        return alert
    
    def _enhance_with_language_model(self, base_alert: str, context: Dict) -> str:
        """Use GPT-2 to enhance alert with additional context"""
        # Create prompt for language model
        prompt = f"Security Alert Context: {base_alert}\nAdditional Details: {context}\nEnhanced Alert:"
        
        # Tokenize prompt
        inputs = self.tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
        
        # Generate enhanced alert
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = self.language_model.generate(
                inputs,
                max_length=inputs.shape[1] + 50,
                num_return_sequences=1,
                temperature=0.7,
                pad_token_id=self.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                do_sample=True
            )
        
        # Decode and extract enhanced alert
        generated_text = self.tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
        enhanced_alert = generated_text.split("Enhanced Alert:")[-1].strip()
        
        return enhanced_alert if enhanced_alert else base_alert
```

## Real-Time Processing and Edge Deployment üîÑ

For a practical CCTV system, real-time processing is crucial. We optimized our model for edge deployment:

```python
class EdgeOptimizedInvision:
    def __init__(self, model_path: str):
        # Load quantized model for faster inference
        self.model = torch.jit.load(model_path)
        self.model.eval()
        
        # Initialize processing queues
        self.frame_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=100)
        self.alert_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=50)
        
        # Start processing threads
        self.processing_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._process_frames)
        self.alert_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._handle_alerts)
        
        self.processing_thread.start()
        self.alert_thread.start()
    
    def _process_frames(self):
        """Background thread for processing video frames"""
        frame_buffer = []
        
        while True:
            try:
                frame = self.frame_queue.get(timeout=1)
                frame_buffer.append(frame)
                
                if len(frame_buffer) >= 16:  # Process 16-frame sequences
                    result = self._analyze_sequence_optimized(frame_buffer)
                    
                    if result['requires_alert']:
                        self.alert_queue.put(result)
                    
                    # Sliding window
                    frame_buffer = frame_buffer[8:]
                    
            except queue.Empty:
                continue
    
    def _analyze_sequence_optimized(self, frames: List[np.ndarray]) -> Dict:
        """Optimized sequence analysis for edge deployment"""
        # Convert frames to tensor batch
        frame_tensors = []
        for frame in frames:
            # Aggressive preprocessing for speed
            frame_small = cv2.resize(frame, (112, 112))  # Smaller input
            frame_tensor = torch.from_numpy(frame_small).float() / 255.0
            frame_tensors.append(frame_tensor.permute(2, 0, 1))
        
        sequence_tensor = torch.stack(frame_tensors).unsqueeze(0)
        
        # Fast inference with reduced precision
        with torch.no_grad():
            with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():  # Mixed precision
                outputs = self.model(sequence_tensor)
        
        # Quick thresholding for alerts
        max_prob = torch.max(outputs['event_probabilities'])
        requires_alert = max_prob > 0.75  # Lower threshold for edge
        
        return {
            'requires_alert': requires_alert,
            'confidence': max_prob.item(),
            'event_type': self._get_event_type(outputs),
            'timestamp': time.time()
        }
```

## Training the Model: Custom Security Dataset üìä

One of the biggest challenges was creating a training dataset for security events. We couldn't use sensitive real CCTV footage, so we got creative:

```python
class SecurityDatasetGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use publicly available datasets and synthetic data
        self.base_datasets = [
            "UCF-Crime",  # Crime video dataset
            "Avenue Dataset",  # Abnormal event detection
            "ShanghaiTech Campus",  # Anomaly detection
            "CUHK Avenue"  # Surveillance videos
        ]
        
        self.synthetic_generator = SyntheticSecurityVideoGenerator()
    
    def create_training_dataset(self) -> List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, str, str]]:
        """Create comprehensive training dataset for security events"""
        dataset = []
        
        # Process each base dataset
        for base_dataset in self.base_datasets:
            videos, labels = self._load_base_dataset(base_dataset)
            
            for video, label in zip(videos, labels):
                # Extract 16-frame sequences
                sequences = self._extract_sequences(video, sequence_length=16)
                
                for sequence in sequences:
                    # Generate natural language description
                    description = self._generate_description(sequence, label)
                    dataset.append((sequence, label, description))
        
        # Add synthetic data to augment rare events
        synthetic_data = self.synthetic_generator.generate_rare_events(
            n_samples=5000,
            event_types=["unauthorized_access", "person_fall", "fire_smoke_detection"]
        )
        
        dataset.extend(synthetic_data)
        
        return dataset
    
    def _generate_description(self, video_sequence: torch.Tensor, event_label: str) -> str:
        """Generate natural language descriptions for training"""
        # Use rule-based generation for training data
        description_templates = {
            "suspicious_loitering": [
                "A person is standing still in the area for an extended period",
                "Individual appears to be waiting or loitering without clear purpose",
                "Person remains stationary in location longer than typical"
            ],
            "unattended_object": [
                "A bag or object has been left alone in the monitored area",
                "Unattended item detected without owner present",
                "Object placed and person moved away, item remains"
            ],
            # ... more templates
        }

            print(f"üö® ALERT {i+1}: {alert}")
    
    def demo_live_camera_feed(self):
        """Demo with actual camera feed from laptop"""

        print("Walk around, sit down, stand up - watch the AI describe your actions!")
        
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Laptop camera
        
        while True:
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                break
            
            # Process frame
            analysis = self.system.analyze_single_frame(frame)
            
            # Display frame with annotations
            annotated_frame = self._annotate_frame(frame, analysis)
            cv2.imshow('Invision-Transformer Live Demo', annotated_frame)
            
            # Print analysis
            if analysis['description']:
                print(f"AI Description: {analysis['description']}")
            
            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                break

## Conclusion: AI That Understands and Communicates üéØ

Winning **HackIreland 2024** with **Invision-Transformer CCTV AI** was an incredible experience that validated our belief in the power of combining computer vision with natural language processing. We didn't just build a technical solution - we created a system that bridges the gap between AI capabilities and human understanding.

The project demonstrates that AI can do more than just detect objects or classify images - it can understand context, reason about situations, and communicate its findings in natural, actionable language. As we continue to develop this technology, I'm excited about its potential to make surveillance systems more intelligent, efficient, and human-friendly.

The 48-hour hackathon experience taught us that with the right team, clear vision, and relentless execution, it's possible to build something truly innovative in a very short time. Most importantly, it reinforced my belief that the future of AI lies not just in raw capability, but in creating systems that can effectively communicate and collaborate with humans.
