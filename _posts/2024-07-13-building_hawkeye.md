As the lead developer at Tata 1mg, designing the Common Order Taking (COT) portal, I realized the critical need for analytics and performance metrics in high-efficiency retail stores, dark stores, and warehouses. When every last rupee counts towards profitability, understanding these metrics is imperative. So during my notice period i have decided to work on something called hawkeye ( i watch cricket a lot and hence the name )

## Introducing HaWk Eye

The idea of HaWk Eye (yes, I wanted to spell it with a capital H and W) was born from this need. I envision it as a computer vision software that can evolve into a great SaaS product. It has the potential to be specialized for very specific use cases like warehouses and retail stores.

## What to Expect

I'll keep updating this blog with my progress on HaWk Eye, detailing what I'm doing and how I'm going about it. For anyone reading this, I aim to keep everything organized in one specific folder. This page will serve as the root for all future updates.

As I pen down this header, I am excited and eager to code. Happy reading!
