*[Free at UCD](https://www.freeatucd.com)*
 is a casual, real-time platform created to help students find free food on campus! University life is packed with events, and this app helps you stay in the know about food giveaways, helping students save on costs and reducing food waste.

*Free at UCD* started as a collaborative student project at University College Dublin (UCD) to help students find free food giveaways across campus. What began as a simple idea has evolved into a robust crowd-sourced web application serving **400-500 daily sessions**, with AWS EC2 + RDS deployment and an innovative OpenCV-based Instagram scraper for automated data ingestion.

## The Inspiration Behind Free at UCD

University life comes with its own set of challenges, and managing expenses is high on that list. Recognizing the frequency of events offering free food and the lack of a centralized platform to inform students about them, we developed *Free at UCD*. Our goal is to reduce food waste and help students save money by connecting them to these opportunities in real-time.

## Technical Overview

Building an application that could handle real-time data and scale efficiently was crucial. Here's how we achieved it:

### Streamlit for Rapid Development

We chose [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) due to its simplicity and the speed at which we could develop interactive web applications. Streamlit allowed us to focus on core functionalities without worrying about the complexities of traditional web development frameworks.

### PostgreSQL Database

For our database, we utilized [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to store location data, food items, availability times, and other relevant information. PostgreSQL's robustness and reliability made it an ideal choice for handling the data-intensive operations of our application.

### Caching the Map for Performance

One of the critical features of *Free at UCD* is the interactive map that displays food giveaway locations. Initially, users experienced delays and reloads when zooming or panning the map. To enhance performance, we implemented caching mechanisms:

- **Map Caching:** By caching the map object, we reduced the load times significantly. Users can now navigate the map smoothly without unnecessary reloads.
- **Data Caching:** We also cached database queries to minimize the number of calls to our PostgreSQL database, thereby improving the application's responsiveness.

### AWS Deployment: EC2 + RDS Architecture

We deployed *Free at UCD* on **AWS EC2** with **RDS (PostgreSQL)** for production-grade scalability and reliability. The architecture ensures we can handle our **400-500 daily sessions** efficiently:

```python
# AWS Configuration for Free at UCD
import boto3
import psycopg2
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import streamlit as st

class AWSInfrastructure:
    def __init__(self):
        # EC2 instance configuration
        self.ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='eu-west-1')  # Ireland region for UCD
        self.rds_endpoint = os.getenv('RDS_ENDPOINT')
        self.db_engine = create_engine(
            f"postgresql://{os.getenv('DB_USER')}:{os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')}@{self.rds_endpoint}/freeatucd"
        )
    
    def setup_auto_scaling(self):
        """Configure auto-scaling for traffic spikes during lunch hours"""
        return {
            'min_instances': 1,
            'max_instances': 3,
            'scale_up_threshold': 70,  # CPU percentage
            'scale_down_threshold': 30,
            'target_group_arn': os.getenv('ALB_TARGET_GROUP_ARN')
        }
```

**Infrastructure Benefits:**
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ RDS deployment ensures 99.9% uptime
- **Auto-Scaling**: Handles lunch-hour traffic spikes (12-2pm sees 300+ concurrent users)
- **Cost Optimization**: t3.micro instances sufficient for our optimized application
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated RDS backups with point-in-time recovery

### OpenCV-Based Instagram Scraper: Automated Data Ingestion

One of our most innovative features is the **OpenCV-powered Instagram scraper** that automatically detects and extracts food giveaway information from UCD society Instagram posts:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import pytesseract
from instagram_private_api import Client
import re
from datetime import datetime

class InstagramFoodScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.instagram_client = Client(username, password)
        self.food_keywords = [
            'free food', 'pizza', 'sandwiches', 'coffee', 'snacks',
            'giveaway', 'complimentary', 'refreshments', 'lunch'
        ]
        self.location_keywords = [
            'student centre', 'library', 'quad', 'belfield', 
            'newman building', 'science centre', 'lecture theatre'
        ]
    
    def scrape_ucd_societies(self):
        """Scrape Instagram posts from UCD societies for food events"""
        ucd_societies = [
            'ucdsu', 'ucd_dramsoc', 'ucd_lawsoc', 'ucd_comsoc',
            'ucd_engsoc', 'ucd_bizzsoc', 'ucd_medsoc'
        ]
        
        food_events = []
        
        for society in ucd_societies:
            recent_posts = self.get_recent_posts(society, limit=10)
            
            for post in recent_posts:
                # Download image

                    if event_details:
                        food_events.append(event_details)
        
        return food_events
    
    def extract_text_from_image(self, image):
        """Use OpenCV + Tesseract to extract text from Instagram posts"""
        # Convert to grayscale

        _, thresh = cv2.threshold(enhanced, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
        
        # Extract text using Tesseract
        custom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6'
        extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh, config=custom_config)
        
        return extracted_text.lower()
    
    def parse_event_details(self, ocr_text, caption_text):
        """Parse event details from extracted text"""
        combined_text = f"{ocr_text} {caption_text}".lower()
        
        # Extract time using regex
        time_pattern = r'(\d{1,2}:\d{2}|\d{1,2}pm|\d{1,2}am)'

# Usage in main application
class FreeAtUCDApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scraper = InstagramFoodScraper()
        self.db_connection = self.setup_database()
    
    def run_automated_scraping(self):
        """Run every 30 minutes to find new food events"""
        while True:
            try:
                new_events = self.scraper.scrape_ucd_societies()
                
                for event in new_events:
                    # Verify event doesn't already exist
                    if not self.event_exists(event):
                        self.add_event_to_database(event)
                        self.notify_subscribers(event)
