As a developer at Tata 1mg, I recently led the upgrade of our Ruby on Rails app from Ruby 2.6 to Ruby 3.2. Our production setup was complex, with dual branches for C-Ruby and JRuby. This migration not only unified the Ruby versions across our services but also paved the way for containerization using Kubernetes (K8s), streamlining our deployment processes. In this post, I'll walk you through the small syntax changes, breaking issues, and the peculiar adjustments I had to make for a smooth transition.

### Why Ruby 3.2?

Ruby 3.2 brings many exciting changes:
- **YJIT**: Faster execution with Just-in-Time compilation.
- **Ractor improvements**: True parallel execution.
- **Memory efficiency**: Improved garbage collection and memory management.
- **Better syntax**: Cleaner and faster code execution.

But along with these came breaking changes that impacted how we wrote and executed code. Below are the key challenges I faced and the solutions I implemented.

---

## 1. **Positional vs. Keyword Arguments**

Ruby 2.7 started the shift with deprecation warnings about positional vs. keyword arguments, and by Ruby 3.2, this became a hard error.

```ruby
# Ruby 2.6 - This works
def method_a(options = {})
  puts options
end

method_a(key: 'value')

# Ruby 3.2 - This raises an ArgumentError
method_a({ key: 'value' })  # Must explicitly pass as a hash
```

**Fix**: All methods that receive keyword arguments need to explicitly define them.

```ruby
# Ruby 3.2 - Fix
def method_a(**options)
  puts options
end

method_a(key: 'value')
```

---

## 2. **Endless Method Definitions**

Ruby 3.0 introduced endless method definitions, improving readability for simple methods. We adopted this in some of our utility methods.

```ruby
# Ruby 2.6
def sum(a, b)
  a + b
end

# Ruby 3.2 - Endless method definition
def sum(a, b) = a + b
```

---

## 3. **Hash Default Values and Frozen Strings**

In Ruby 3.0, string literals are frozen by default, which can lead to errors if your code modifies strings or uses mutable defaults in hashes.

```ruby
# Ruby 2.6
hash = Hash.new('')
hash[:key] << 'value'   # This works fine

# Ruby 3.2
hash = Hash.new('')
hash[:key] << 'value'   # FrozenError: can't modify frozen String
```

**Fix**: Use a block to return a mutable default.

```ruby
# Ruby 3.2 - Fix
hash = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = '' }
hash[:key] << 'value'   # Works fine
```

---

## 4. **Pattern Matching Improvements**

Ruby 3.x introduced expanded pattern matching, making it easier to work with complex data.

```ruby
# Ruby 3.2 - Pattern Matching Example
case [1, 2, 3]
in [a, b, *rest]
  puts "a=#{a}, b=#{b}, rest=#{rest}"
end
# Outputs: a=1, b=2, rest=[3]
```

---

## 5. **Deprecation of `#to_h` with No Arguments**

`#to_h` used to work without arguments in Ruby 2.6, but not anymore in Ruby 3.2.

```ruby
# Ruby 2.6
my_hash = { key: 'value' }
my_hash.to_h    # This works

# Ruby 3.2 - This throws an error
my_hash.to_h    # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1)
```

**Fix**: Provide arguments or handle the conversion explicitly.

```ruby
# Ruby 3.2 - Fix
my_hash.to_h { |pair| pair }   # Works fine
```

---

## 6. **Ractor and Thread Safety**

One of the most exciting features of Ruby 3.x is **Ractor**, enabling parallel execution. However, global variables and shared state need to be refactored for thread safety.

```ruby
# Ruby 2.6 - Global caching
$cache = {}

def cache_result(key, value)
  $cache[key] = value
end

# Ruby 3.2 - Ractor-safe refactor
class Cache
  def initialize
    @cache = {}
    @lock = Mutex.new
  end

  def cache_result(key, value)
    @lock.synchronize { @cache[key] = value }
  end
end
```

---

## 7. **Other Minor Gotchas**

- **`Bignum` and `Fixnum` unified into `Integer`**: Ensure no legacy code depends on these.
- **`URI.encode` and `URI.decode`** are deprecated: Use `URI.encode_www_form` or `CGI.escape`.
- **Method visibility with blocks**: Ruby 3.x changes how visibility modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`) interact with methods accepting blocks.

## The Benefits of the Migration

The upgrade to Ruby 3.2 not only gave us performance improvements (thanks to YJIT) but also allowed us to unify our C-Ruby and JRuby branches into a single Ruby version. This paved the way for transitioning our production app to Kubernetes (K8s), making deployments more streamlined and scalable.

With faster processing, reduced memory overhead, and the flexibility of containerized microservices, this migration allowed us to improve overall system efficiency while simplifying our infrastructure management.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Ruby 2.6 to Ruby 3.2 in a production environment comes with its challenges, but the benefits far outweigh the effort. By addressing syntax changes, frozen string literals, and thread safety, we were able to optimize both performance and deployment. Ruby 3.2, paired with Kubernetes, made our production processes faster, more efficient, and easier to manage.

This migration has set the stage for future improvements in both code performance and infrastructure scalability, and I highly recommend other teams to make the switch.

Happy coding!
