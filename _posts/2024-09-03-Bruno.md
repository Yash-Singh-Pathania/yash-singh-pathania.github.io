APIs are crucial today, but testing tools  inlcuding dev testing especially between devs is a hassle. The most popular tool, Postman, has become bloated, with many features hidden behind a paywall. This led me on a search for an open-source, privacy-focused API testing tool‚Äî**Bruno**.

## Why Bruno? ü§î

Bruno lets users store collections and API requests, traditionally kept in Postman, but with a more streamlined, Git-friendly approach. This eliminates the confusion of having API requests versioned separately from your code, making it easier to share cURL requests across teams like QA, product, and other stakeholders.

### Personal Story Time! üìñ

Let me tell you about the time I first tried Bruno. I was working on a hackathon project at an internal event at [1mg](https://www.1mg.com), and the APIs were a tangled mess. Our team struggled with complex collections and bloated workspaces. Then, I found Bruno. It felt like discovering a secret weapon. Suddenly, APIs were fun again! I could clone a repo, see real examples, and get to work immediately. No more "Where‚Äôs that JSON file?" moments. üí°

## Bruno vs. Other API Tools üîç
### Key Benefits:
- **Lightweight & User-Friendly Interface**: Bruno‚Äôs snappy UI is built with Electron and available on all major desktop platforms‚ÄîLinux, Mac, and Windows. Unlike Postman, Bruno is entirely offline, ensuring your data stays on your machine.
  
- **Privacy First**: Unlike Postman, which routes API requests through proprietary proxy servers, Bruno handles requests directly from your computer, keeping your data private and secure.

- **Git Integration**: Bruno uses a plain text markup language called Bru, storing API requests directly in your repository. This allows seamless version control and collaboration using tools like Git.

### Additional Features:
- **No Paywall**: Bruno is a FOSS project with no hidden fees, unlike Postman, which locks essential features behind a paywall.
- **Unlimited Collection Runs**: Postman limits collection runs, but with Bruno, you can run collections as many times as you like.
- **Secret Management**: Load secrets directly from a `.env` file, eliminating the need to manage them separately.
- **Declarative Scripting**: Write tests and update post-response variables using simple expressions, supported by Bruno‚Äôs declarative scripting features.
- **CLI Support**: Run API collections with ease using Bruno‚Äôs CLI, integrating smoothly with your CI/CD workflows.

### The Future of API Testing üõ†Ô∏è

Bruno is revolutionizing API testing by focusing on privacy, efficiency, and user control. By co-locating API collections with your source code and enabling Git management, Bruno offers a cohesive and secure solution for developers and teams.
