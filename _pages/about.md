Hey there! I'm a master's student in [Computer Science Negotiated Learning](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=T150) at University College Dublin. Before this, I worked at [Tata 1mg](https://www.1mg.com/aboutUs?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search) as a Software Developer on [ODIN](https://odin.1mg.com/login), an awesome warehouse management software for medicine supply chains.

I'm really into NLP and machine learning, and I've worked on various projects, including a [research paper](https://www.techscience.com/cmc/v70n3/44965). Want to know more? Check out my CV and projects tab on this site. Don’t miss the blogs section—I’d love to hear your thoughts!

I'm also big into sports. So, if it's not a job you're offering, a game of hoop would be a delight too.

Feel free to reach out at [yashpathania704@gmail.com](mailto:yashpathania704@gmail.com). Let's connect!
Also i use obsidian a lot so this entire webiste is basically markdown.

When I'm not immersed in coding, Is enjoy exploring various interests and hobbies that keep me grounded in the real world. I love to scuba dive and play basketball so if you know any dive spots nearby feel free to connect, 
Check out [Misc](./misc) section to see what I'm up to outside of coding. After all, life is lived beyond the confines of .py files.

Oh, and I’m currently in the beautiful country of Ireland! 🌍

***Haigh, go raibh maith agat as bheith anseo!***
