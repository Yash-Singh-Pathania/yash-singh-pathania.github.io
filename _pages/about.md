Hey there!! I'm an AI Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com/) in Dublin, Ireland, working on cutting-edge AI solutions and recently completed my MSc in [Computer Science and AI](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=T150) from University College Dublin with First Class Honours (4.1/4.2 GPA), graduating in the top 1% of my class.

At Honeywell, I've built a scalable Vertex AI multi-agent drafting platform with robust prompt templates and PEFT fine-tuning for domain-aligned document generation, partnering directly with Google Dublin engineering. I also engineered an LLM factuality evaluation system built on Meta's FactScore, achieving a 71% cycle-time reduction (from 2 weeks to 4 days) through deterministic pipelines with LangGraph and NER - which has a patent pending!

Before Honeywell, I worked at [Tata 1mg](https://www.1mg.com/aboutUs?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search) as a Software Developer, where I led development of Common Order Taking (COT) ‚Äî an in-house POS system, adopting microservices and async paradigms to boost throughput by 30% (won Team of the Quarter!). I also implemented an LLM-powered semantic search within COT, increasing order conversion by 28%, and fabricated an ML-driven auto-replenishment module for Odin, India's largest medicine WMS, using ARIMA & LSTM for demand forecasting.

I'm passionate about AI/ML, NLP, and have published research including a [co-authored paper](https://www.techscience.com/cmc/v70n3/44965) on a novel LSTM-CNN model that achieved state-of-the-art accuracy for emotion classification. I love building innovative solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

I enjoy exploring various interests and hobbies that keep me grounded in the real world. I love to scuba dive ü§ø and am a COAS 1 start scuba diver and play basketball üèÄ. If you know any dive spots or want to hoop, feel free to reach out. Check out the [Misc](./misc) section to see what I'm up to outside of coding.

Feel free to reach out at [yashpathania704@gmail.com](mailto:yashpathania704@gmail.com). Let's connect! I use Obsidian a lot, so this entire website is basically Markdown.  

Oh, and I‚Äôm currently in the beautiful country of Ireland! üåç
