Hey there! I'm a master's student in [Computer Science Negotiated Learning](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=T150) at University College Dublin. Before this, I worked at [Tata 1mg](https://www.1mg.com/aboutUs?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search) as a Software Developer on [ODIN](https://odin.1mg.com/login), an inhouse  data science driven warehouse management software for medicine supply chains serviing about 100k orders in a day.

I'm passionate about NLP and machine learning and have worked on various projects, including a [research paper](https://www.techscience.com/cmc/v70n3/44965). Want to know more? Check out my CV and projects tab on this site. Don’t miss the blogs section—I’d love to hear your thoughts!

When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy exploring various interests and hobbies that keep me grounded in the real world. I love to scuba dive 🤿 and play basketball 🏀. If you know any dive spots or want to hoop, feel free to reach out. Check out the [Misc](./misc) section to see what I'm up to outside of coding.

Feel free to reach out at [yashpathania704@gmail.com](mailto:yashpathania704@gmail.com). Let's connect! I use Obsidian a lot, so this entire website is basically Markdown.

Oh, and I’m currently in the beautiful country of Ireland! 🌍
