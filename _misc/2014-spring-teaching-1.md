I love to cook and was lucky enough to participate in one of the biggest reality TV shows in India, “Young Chef Ahmedabad,” as a high schooler. 🍳

As an international student in Ireland, I enjoy exploring new cuisines and cooking for friends. If you’re nearby, feel free to drop by for a meal—good food and great company never hurt anyone! 🌍🍲
