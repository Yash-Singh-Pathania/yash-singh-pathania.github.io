During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the unexpected opportunity to be in [Port Blair](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Port+Blair), a series of stunning islands in the southwest of India. It was here that I took the plunge—literally—and learned how to scuba dive at a professional level.

### The Communication Fiasco 🤿

Before diving into the details of how scuba diving changed my life, I have to share this one unforgettable (and somewhat embarrassing) experience. So, I had just completed my scuba certification and was all set to guide a French family on their first dive. Confident in my communication skills, especially after a 700-day streak on Duolingo for French (yep, I was feeling pretty accomplished), I started explaining the basics to their little kid. The mom kept reiterating everything I said in French, and I naturally assumed she was just being an overprotective mom, reminding her kid to be extra careful underwater.

Fast forward a bit—halfway through the dive, the kid starts having issues, so we surface. When I asked what was wrong, it hit me like a ton of bricks—the mom wasn't just reiterating my instructions; she was translating them. 🤦‍♂️ There I was, in the middle of the Indian Ocean, realizing that my 700-day Duolingo streak had failed me because, guess what? Duolingo doesn't have a scuba lesson! 😅 The kid had no idea what I was talking about the entire time. Lesson learned: never underestimate the importance of clear communication, especially when it involves diving!

Looking back, I can confidently say that learning to scuba dive was one of the best decisions of my life. 🧜‍♂️ Not only did it help me stay physically active, but it also did wonders for my mental health. 🌊

### Mental Health Benefits 🌟

In a time when the world felt closed off and restricted, diving offered me a sense of freedom I hadn't experienced in a while. Being underwater, surrounded by the vibrant marine life, gave me a perspective that was both humbling and refreshing. It was like meditation, but with fish! 🐠 Each dive was a journey into a tranquil world, where all my worries and anxieties seemed to dissolve into the blue.

### New Friendships 🤝

Another incredible aspect of this experience was the people I met along the way. The diving community in Port Blair was welcoming, and I quickly made friends who shared the same passion. These friendships went beyond just diving; we bonded over our love for exploration and adventure, and some of these connections have lasted long after the diving courses ended.

### Coding, Calmness, and Creativity 💻

Interestingly, the calm and focus I found underwater also translated into my work. As a coder, I often face challenges that require a clear mind and steady patience—traits that scuba diving helped me cultivate. There's something about the rhythmic breathing and the slow, deliberate movements underwater that taught me to approach my coding problems with a similar mindset. 🧘‍♂️

Diving also sparked a new wave of creativity in me. Being in such a unique environment inspired me to think differently, and I found myself coming up with innovative solutions in my work that I might not have otherwise considered. Plus, the calmness I felt after each dive made it easier to tackle even the most frustrating bugs.

### Final Thoughts ✨

In many ways, scuba diving during the pandemic wasn't just a hobby; it was a lifeline. It brought new experiences, new friends, and a renewed sense of peace and creativity into my life. If you ever get the chance to dive, I highly recommend it—it's more than just an adventure; it's a way to connect with yourself and the world in a whole new way.
